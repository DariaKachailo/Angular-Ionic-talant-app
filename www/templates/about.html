				<blockquote class="about_article my_color">Welcome to the official guide to building HTML5 mobile apps with the Ionic Framework, written by the creators of Ionic. It contains all you need to know to get started building apps with Ionic, and lays a foundation for more advanced development.

				If you've used other mobile development frameworks in the past, you should find Ionic fairly similar to use. But getting started with any framework is always daunting, so we will start simple and expand on some basic concepts. But first, we need to talk a bit about the Ionic project itself, where it fits into the dev stack, and why we built it.</blockquote>
